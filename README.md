<!--DESCRIPTION-->
<p>
This project was done in just 1 week as part of our web development Bootcamp assignments at Ironhack. Requirements: create an app just using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB an homemade internal API Rest and an external API using Google Maps.
  
The project is based on an encyclopaedia of plants whose characteristics are being researched for medicinal use. The user can access the specific plants and see their characteristics, as well as access a list of events in different parts of the world and register and see their location via Google Maps.
